## Robotics Language

The Robotics Language is an open extensible domain-specific (or model-based) language for robotics. RoL is an abstraction on top of ROS to efficiently and quickly develop ROS applications using a mathematics-centred language. RoL generates ROS c++ nodes, HTML interfaces, or any other elements. The base RoL language has a structure similar to standard high-level programming languages.
